title: Clients, The Ones You Love and The Ones You Hate.
category: workflow
excerpt: Why I have a love hate relationship with some of my clients and it's probably my fault.
---

<p>Here's the thing, I love working with people. Providing websites to clients that help grow their business which in turn provides them more financial comfortability drives my motivation.</p>

<p>But, BUT, when I deliver a website to a client (based from their goals and requests) and they request:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They'd like to incorporate my original idea now instead of theirs</li>
  <li>They think something is still missing (but have no idea what it is)</li>
  <li>They want to go back to the drawing board and start over.</li>
  <li>NOTE: These are tremendously worse when the project your doing is FREE (non-profits, church websites etc.).</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the very reason why</p>

<h3>Clearly defining client goals from the beginning is so damn important!</h3>

<p>I can count with no hands the times that not clearly defining client goals lead to a seamless workflow for myself and the client. (no hands as in none).</p>

<p><strong>Some people may think, "but don't you charge each time they want something modified?"</strong> Of course I do! But I'm not only in this industry to make money. I would much rather get paid less (by not having to modify a client's project after deployment) and create intriguing collaborative projects that everything is done perfectly the first time we deploy. "Hindsight 20/20 I wouldn't have done it the same" with many clients. Instead here is what I would have done and what I will be doing from this point on for paid projects and non-profits.</p>

<h3>Utilize Agile Software Development</h3>

<p><strong>Agile Software Development (ASD) - In software application development, agile software development (ASD) is a methodology for the creative process that anticipates the need for flexibility and applies a level of pragmatism into the delivery of the finished product. Agile software development focuses on keeping code simple, testing often, and delivering functional bits of the application as soon as they're ready.</strong></p>

<p>By utilizing ASD for each new set of features (or objectives that are defined by the sprint or two week increment of the development process) you discuss with the client what has been done if the client would like any modifications and then progress to the next sprint until the project is finished. This provides a much more transparent and seamless experience for both the client and the developer.</p>

<h3>Add Cooperation from the client mandatory in your contract</h3>

<p>This is something that with older clients I really wish I would have implemented in their contracts. By stating in your contract that (this project is a partnership between the client and yourself and a lack of cooperation from their end will result in residual penalties you can make sure that your clients cannot blow you off or procrastinate giving you the assets, feedback, funding etc. that you need to make their website dream come true.</p>

<h3>When they're being an ass, tell them!</h3>

<p>Look, I'm not saying call them out on every little thing they do that irritates you but you have got to make it clear that their lack of involvement or their indecisiveness is making it difficult to work with them. Sometimes the best way to do that is to be real with them. If they have changed their mind for the 15th time and the project is going way over the anticipated deadline then saying something like, "Look John, your wasting both our time and your money switching things back and forth on a feature that more than likely your customers are going to enjoy either/or. As your web develper I highly advise that we move onto the next objective." Your client will 9/10 times respect what you're telling them because you are the web developer and you have the expertise.</p>

<h3>Deploy the website and get them on a monthly website maintenance plan</h3>

<p>This is a great option since most of the time your client will have website updates 1-2 a month. This is a great way to make passive income for a large majority of the month and they change as many features if they would like.</p>

<h3>For You Non-Profits Out There</h3>

<p>Non-Profits in my opinion are some of the worst clients to work for. Most non-profits have missions to do a lot of good in the world and creating website to help spread the word about their mission is a very rewarding experience. That said, if you are designing their website for free (which most smaller non-profit websites are created for free) then you will begin to realize that they take advantage of your services. They know what a modern website costs and so they want to make sure they get as much free stuff as possible so they don't have to hire someone to manage it or update it. I don't blame them, they lack a budget and most of the staff are overworked and underpaid. I don't want to sound like a narcissist here but overtime you have to ask yourself, how much money are you using by bending over backwards for non-profits? My suggestion, do 1-2 non-profit projects a year. They provide excellent networking opportunities and you are helping organizations make the world a better place. Just don't forget to utilize the other methods mentioned in this post to the best of your ability to make sure they don't completely rape your time.</p>

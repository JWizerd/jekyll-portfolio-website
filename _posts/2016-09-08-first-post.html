excerpt: Why I have a love hate relationship with some of my clients and it's probably my fault.

<h2>{{ post.title }}</h2>

<p>Here's the thing, I love working with people. Providing website to clients that help grow their business which in turn provides them more financial comfortability drives my motivation.</p>

<p>But, BUT, when I deliver a website to a client (based from their goals and requests) and they request:</p>

<ul>
  <li>They'd like to incorporate my original idea now instead of theirs</li>
  <li>They think something is still missing (but have no idea what it is)</li>
  <li>They want to go back to the drawing board and start over.</li>
  <li>NOTE: These are tremendously worse when the project your doing is FREE (non-profits are the worst).</li>
</ul>

<p>This is the very reason why</p>

<h3>Clearly defining client goals from the beginning is so damn important!</h3>

<p>I can count with no hands the times that not clearly defining client goals lead to a seamless workflow for myself and the client. (no hands as in none).</p>

<p><strong>Some people may think, "but don't you charge each time they want something modified?"</strong> Of course I do! But I'm not only in this industry to make money. I would much rather get paid less (by not having modify a client's project after deployment) and create intriguing collaborative projects that everything is done perfectly the first time we deploy. "Hindsight 20/20 I wouldn't have done it the same" with many clients. Instead here is what I would have done and what I will be doing from this point on paid project or non-profit.</p>

<h3>Utilize Agile Principles</h3>

<dl>
  <dt>Agile Software Development (ASD)</dt>
  <dd>In software application development, agile software development (ASD) is a methodology for the creative process that anticipates the need for flexibility and applies a level of pragmatism into the delivery of the finished product. Agile software development focuses on keeping code simple, testing often, and delivering functional bits of the application as soon as they're ready.</dd>
</dl>

<p>By utilizing ASD for each new set of features (or objectives that are defined by the sprint or two week increment of the development process) you discuss with the client what has been done if the client would like any modifications and then progress to the next sprint until the project is finished. This provides a much more transparent and seamless experience for both the client and the developer.</p>

<h3>Add Cooperation from the client mandatory in your contract</h3>

<p>This is something that with older clients I really wish I would have implemented in their contracts. By stating in your contract that (this project is a partnership between client and yourself and a lack of cooperation from their end will result in residual penalties you can make sure that your clients cannot blow you off or procrastinate giving you the assets, feedback, funding etc. that you need to make their website dream come true.</p>

title: Bilingual Programmers, why knowing multiple languages isn't as hard as you think.
category: programming
excerpt: Most programmers end up programming in a myriad of different languages during their career and here's why it's not as intimidating as you think it is.

<p>Most progammers starting out are affraid of the idea of having to learn another language. Here the general reason why:</p>

<ol>
  <li>They believe what they've learned in their other language won't apply to the next.</li>
  <li>They believe data types are a thing only native to their first language of choice.</li>
  <li>They are like me and want "focus on mastering at 1 language first"</li>
  <li>They've only just begun tooo liiiivvvveeeeeeee or start proramming as everyone else puts it.</li>
  <li>Due to technical difficulties (lack of coffee) I cannot think of another reason but there are plenty.</li>
</ol>

<p>The thing is, most beginner programmers, like myself are still very intimidated by programming so our rational minds fail to help us take a breath and realize that the large majority of computer science fundamentals apply to <strong>ANY LANGUAGE</strong></p>

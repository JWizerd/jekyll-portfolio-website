    "description": "My first client as a freelance Web Designer and Internet Marketer. The president of the firm, James Vucinovich stated in quote 'Due to Jeremiah's work we have drastically changed the infrastructure of our company'. Only after a short period of time (6 months) with my SEO strategy, Internet Marketing and new website layout my client had experienced more leads (some leading to big settlement cases) than they had in two years working with their previous web company.",

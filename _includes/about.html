                    <strong>Dude, I love web development.</strong> I'm such a fan of the long hours staring at a screen, 50 cups of coffee, the high you get when everything in your project is finally working, the frustration when you're trying to learn a new concept and realizing that the only reason your code isn't running is because you mispelled the name of a method. It's not just that either; It's the creativity I get to invoke into making something simple like a web page into something that makes information a more enjoyable experience for people to view. At the end of the day who cares if "JavaScript has no class" or PHP gives breaks your entire page because your forgot a semi-colon. My career is awesome because I get the luxury of working with fantastic communities of people, helping small businesses, just like me, grow so they can give they can "make the world a better place". The characters I type on this screen every day help people in so many ways and You know what? My journey has only just begun.

              <p>
                I'm a clear communicator with a background in customer service leadership and sales. I have a passion for making a client's vision of their website a reality and not only that, but to make sure that site targets the audience they are seeking. My goal with each client is to achieve business goals by creating an interpersonal relationship between the client and myself.

                I also have an extensive background in photography from portrait, landscape and product. I have the equipment and the skill to take professional photos for web content such as ecommerce, header images, company, business location etc. as well as marketing content for social, PPC, business listings and email. I also have an extensive background in Photoshop and illustrator. You can view my personal work on <a href="http://facebook.com/JeremiahWodkePhotography" title="My Facebook Photography Page">Facebook</a>. A web developer who is also proficient in design, marketing and leadership is a wonderful asset to have for small start-ups. An employee with the necessary skills such as these will save companies the money and time that is required for finding a professional photographer or graphic designer.
